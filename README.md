## App walkthrough:

### Authorization

Users can register to create a profile and log in using their email address and created password.

#### Viewing an event

Clicking on an event card will take the user to an event page, where they can see the description, other members, likes and comments.

#### Joining an event

Clicking "join event" will add the user to the event, giving them the ability to like and comment, and post their daily completions. Users can only join events that haven't yet started. The event now appears in the user's dashboard, and user can select between events if signed up to multiple events.
